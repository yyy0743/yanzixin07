        <h1>Healthcare Facilities Coverage in Singapore</h1>

        <p><i>Healthcare Facilities Coverage in Singapore</i> is a data visualization project that examines the distribution of healthcare facilities across HDB residential areas. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> leverages government open data to map the locations of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across Singapore. To assess coverage, the project defines service areas based on network distances: hospitals are considered accessible within 1,000 meters, while clinics and pharmacies are evaluated within a 500-meter range. This analysis helps identify well-served areas as well as potential gaps in healthcare coverage.
            <br><br>
            Through the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, users can contribute by reporting areas where healthcare services may be lacking or sharing insights on alternative medical service points via the Ushahidi platform.
